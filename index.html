      <p id = 'intro'>We all get stressed out from time to time. Has your human been gone for more than 4 minutes? Has the UPS guy come back again to destroy all that you love? Did your favorite
         ball roll under the couch, just out of reach?
         Well pooches, the science is in, and stress is downright ruff on our brains. Luckily, stress's bark is worse than its bite, so we can ward it off with some mind centering yoga.
         2021 is all about you, baby. It's time to stop and smell the fire hydrants. Fortunately for all of you, I've put together this guide that even a cat could follow. <br>

         <p>This one was named for us! Stretch that belly out! The longer the torso, the more surface areas for scratchies. When I'm in this pose, I like to imagine I'm on a farm, surrounded by 
            piggies, birdies, and plenty of horse manure. As long as I'm far out of range of that dang barn cat. Oh yeah, I feel less pup-tight already.

         <p>It's our time to shine again in perhaps the most famous of all the poses. I do this pose at the same time every day (except Sundays): right before that wicked mailman comes to my door.
            I like to get my shoulders nice and limber before I chase him off the property before he can enact his malicious schemes. My person (I've named her Lassie) never seems to appreciate all
            the work I do for her, but she doesn't know what's good for her. I mean, she stares at a small light up box all day (sometimes she even has conversations with it) instead of playing 
            with me, so she obviously needs some guidance.

         <p>You know what my favorite thing is? I just love it when I'm getting up from my memory foam doggie bed and I stretch out and Lassie says, "biiiiiig stretch!" This pose will help you 
            practice for when it's time to perform so you can wow your person with your ultimate big stretches. I've observed a direct correlation in the number of scratches behind the ears and
            the stretchiness of the stretch. It's science.

         </figure>
         <p>When Lassie falls down on the job, I just have to make the ground pet me. If I'm really wanting to send the message, I'll do this pose in the mud to get good and gross. It gets all those
            hard to reach places all while giving my spine a good decompressing stretch. While I hate bath time, Lassie will keep her eye on me much closer to make sure I don't get into anything 
            messy. She can't stay mad at me. I'm too cute.

         </figure>
         <p>Sometimes, Lassie puts something that makes sense on the bigger light up box that she's looking at while she's also looking at the smaller light up box. It's a video of different 
            birds, big cats, elephants, and all these other creatures in all these faraway lands. What better way to enjoy the sounds of nature than to kick back and close your eyes? 
            Hasn't your belly been through enough today since you got into the garbage while your person was outside without you? A bonus about this pose is that if you stay in it long enough, 
            your person will definitely give you a very thorough belly rub. They can't resist the sight of a neglected puppy belly.
