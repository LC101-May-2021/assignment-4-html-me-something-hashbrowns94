      <p id = 'intro'>We all get stressed out from time to time. Has your human been gone for more than 4 minutes? Has the UPS guy come back again to destroy all that you love? Did your favorite bone
         roll under the couch, just out of reach?
         Well pooches, the science is in, and stress is downright ruff on our brains. Luckily, stress's bark is worse than its bite, so we can ward it off with some mind centereding yoga.
         2021 is all about you, baby. It's time to stop and smell the fire hydrants. I've put together this guide that even a cat could follow. Each model is accompanied by a description for
         each pose.

      <h3>Upward Facing Dog</h3>

      <p>This one was named for us! Stretch that belly out! The longer the torso, the more surface areas for scratchies. When I'm in this pose, I like to imagine I'm on a farm, surrounded by 
         piggies, birdies, and plenty of horse manure. As long as I'm far out of range of that dang barn cat. Oh yeah, I feel less pup-tight already.
